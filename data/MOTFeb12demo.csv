I think that I did okay, I definitely did not do perfect but I also feel as though I managed to get a majority correct.	I did not notice myself using any special strategies.

I do not particularly think that I did notice much differing between background images. The main reasoning for this may be due to how focused I was on the bouncing dots.	I did not notice this.
